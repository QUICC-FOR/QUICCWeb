<h3>An applied research project on forest ecosystems...</h3>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left:35px;">
QUICC-FOR is a strategic project that aims to develop a suite of forest dynamic
models for natural resources managers to better understand how current land-use
practices will affect the diversity, productivity and resilience of forest
ecosystems. This modeling suite will provide predictions for local scales and
short time horizons (10-25 years) up to the large spatial scales and long time
horizons (100- 200 years). </p>

		The mid point of projected warming at the end of this
		century is approximately 3.5Â°C (IPCC 2014). The current tools used to predict
		climate change impact on forest ecosystems are limited because they lack
		important, inherent ecological knowledge. On the one hand, foresters use
		growth and yield curves parameterized for different regions and climates to
		project future productivity. These are inappropriate because they do not
		consider how the complex ecological interactions between the different tree
		species will change with novel conditions. On the other hand, the predictions
		of future species distribution are typically based on the current correlation
		between observed distribution and several climate descriptors. These models
		are also inappropriate for forest ecosystems because they do not consider how
		the complex interplay between dispersal, interspecific interactions and forest
		management will affect migration dynamics. </p>

		This project is unique in linking the best forest ecologists and
		modelers from Canada, USA and Europe to provide them tools that will
		be used to assess the impacts and risks of climate change on the
		productivity of the forests of Eastern Canada. QUICC-FOR is mainly
		funded by <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp">
