    <h3><i class="icon-home"></i>  What is QUICC-FOR ?</h3>
    <p align="justify">The current tools used to predict climate change impact on forest ecosystems are limited because they lack important, inherent ecological knowledge. On the one hand, foresters use growth and yield curves parameterized for different regions and climates to project future productivity. These are inappropriate because they do not consider how the complex ecological interactions between the different tree species will change with novel conditions. On the other hand, the predictions of future species distribution are typically based on the current correlation between observed distribution and several climate descriptors. These models are also inappropriate for forest ecosystems because they do not consider how the complex interplay between dispersal, interspecific interactions and forest management will affect migration dynamics. </p>

    <p align="justify">This project is unique in linking the best forest ecologists and modelers from Canada, USA and Europe to provide them tools that will be used to assess the impacts of and risks of climate change on the productivity of the forests of Eastern Canada.</p>
